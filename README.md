## markdown file syntax for post

your markdown file must follow syntax: `yyyy-mm-dd-this-is-slug.md`. example `2020-11-01-hello-world.md` then will be parsed become `$post->created_at = '2020-11-01'` and `$post->slug = 'hellow-world'`

```
// the first is yaml likes format
---
layout: post // refence to resources/views/post.blade.php, use for building html
title: This is post title // $post->title = 'This is post title'
foo: bar // $post->foo = 'bar'
tags[]: dog, cat, pekyll // $post->tags = ['dog', 'cat', 'pekyll']
---

|------------------|------------------|
| `pekyll new`     | create new fresh blog |
| `pekyll build`   | build your blog to html files |
| `pekyll serve`   | run a development server, replace asset's folders in public by symbolic link |

## routes

There are only 2 types of route:
- `page`: `xxx.html` rendered from `resources/views/pages`
- `post`: `posts/xxx.html` rendered from `posts/`

## how it works

`pekyll` parse content of file in the `posts` directory to make `post` html file. After that, it starts build `pages`. There for you can access all the posts in the pages view via `$posts` variable, it's a [`Collection`](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/collections#introduction) of `Post` class. You are free to filters go get what you want here.
