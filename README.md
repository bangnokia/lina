## Getting started

There are some ways to install Lina:

Require Lina as dependency, with this option, you can keep lina up-to-date easily.

```bash
mkdir my-blog
composer init # then follow the instructions
composer require bangnokia/lina
./vendor/bin/lina new . # scaffolding a new blog skeleton in the current directory
./vendor/bin/lina serve # start a development server and happy writing
```

Or install Lina as global composer package

```bash

```

Or you can use the `phar` file
```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/bangnokia/lina/releases/latest/download/lina.phar && chmod +x lina.phar
```

## Folder structure

In case you want to migrate from another blog platform, you can check the base structure of Lina

```
content/
    posts/
        2020-11-01-hello.md
    index.md
resources/
    views/
        index.blade.php
        post.blade.php
public/ 
    images/
    style.css
```

- `content` directory is where you store your markdown content file.
- `resources/views` directory is where you store your blade template.
- `public` directory is where you store your assets like images, css, ... This folder is also where all the generated
  files are stored. So please remember to add your custom files to `.gitignore` if you want to store them in `git`

**We really recommend you to prefix your content file with the date, so it will easy to sort and find your content. Lina
automatically strip the date from the slug, so you don't need to worry about the url.**

## Helper functions

There are some functions that you can use to programmatically access your content.

### Get all content in a directory

Get all the content in a directory. The content will be sorted by the date in the filename.

```php
foreach (lina()->index('post') as $post) {
    echo $post->title;
}
```

### Get a single content

```php
$post = lina()->get('posts/2020-11-01-hello.md');
```

## Deployments

Lina can be deployed to any static hosting provider. Here are some examples: Github pages, Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare
pages, ...

### Deploy on Github pages

So you please modify the file `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to match your demand.

### Deploy on Cloudflare pages
